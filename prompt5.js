// Write a function that takes a single positive whole integer, N

// N = 9, M = 4     [4, 8]
// N = 3, M = 1     [1, 2, 3]


// have M divisible by the N number
// Modoulo the M and see how many times it can be divisible in that array,
//  have the M divide by itself and then push every number that it is divisible into
// an empty array
// how many times/what numbers can M be divisible into N
